                    VCC's World lets users secure an account with a username,
                    password, and email address. And that's about all the
                    personal information you have to provide to make payments.
                    This allows for safe, anonymous purchases, as well as making
                    returns a breeze.

                    It's not easy to find online retailers and services that
                    accept crypto payments. But even if they do, you'd rather
                    not reveal your crypto wallet. That's why we use VCC's and a
                    user crypto currency â€“ this allows you to buy something that
                    doesn't with accept credit cards or bitcoin.
